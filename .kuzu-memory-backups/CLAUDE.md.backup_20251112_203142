# Rustbot - Event-Driven AI Assistant

## What We're Building

Rustbot is a sophisticated AI assistant application built in Rust, featuring:
- Event-driven architecture with priority-based interrupts
- Real-time LLM integration with streaming responses
- Extensible tool/plugin system
- Lightweight egui-based UI with comprehensive activity visualization
- Native performance with minimal resource overhead

## Project Documentation

### Design Specifications
- **Full Architecture Spec**: `docs/design/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Development Plan**: `docs/PRD/development-plan.md`

### Current Phase
**Phase 1: POC Chatbot**
- Goal: Basic chatbot with streaming responses
- LLM Provider: OpenRouter (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- Focus: Get core LLM integration working before building event system

### Key Technologies
- **Language**: Rust (edition 2021)
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio
- **UI Framework**: egui/eframe
- **LLM Provider**: OpenRouter API
- **HTTP Client**: reqwest with streaming support

## Getting Started

1. Review the architecture specification in `docs/design/ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. Check current development plan in `docs/PRD/development-plan.md`
3. Install Rust toolchain: `rustup update stable`
4. Build: `cargo build`
5. Run: `cargo run`

## Development Notes

- All shared state uses Arc<RwLock<T>> for thread safety
- Use structured logging with `tracing` crate
- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Prioritize correctness over premature optimization
- Event-driven design: everything is an event
