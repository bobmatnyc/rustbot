# Project Memory Configuration

This project uses KuzuMemory for intelligent context management.

## Project Information
- **Path**: /Users/masa/Projects/rustbot
- **Language**: Unknown
- **Framework**: Unknown

## Memory Integration

KuzuMemory is configured to enhance all AI interactions with project-specific context.

### Available Commands:
- `kuzu-memory enhance <prompt>` - Enhance prompts with project context
- `kuzu-memory learn <content>` - Store learning from conversations (async)
- `kuzu-memory recall <query>` - Query project memories
- `kuzu-memory stats` - View memory statistics

### MCP Tools Available:
When interacting with Claude Desktop, the following MCP tools are available:
- **kuzu_enhance**: Enhance prompts with project memories
- **kuzu_learn**: Store new learnings asynchronously
- **kuzu_recall**: Query specific memories
- **kuzu_stats**: Get memory system statistics

## Project Context

**Rustbot** is an AI chat assistant application built in Rust with egui for the UI. It connects to LLM providers via OpenRouter API and features real-time streaming responses, token tracking, cost calculation, and customizable system prompts.

## Key Technologies
- **Language**: Rust (Edition 2021)
- **UI Framework**: egui 0.29 + eframe
- **Async Runtime**: tokio 1.40
- **HTTP Client**: reqwest 0.12 (with streaming)
- **Serialization**: serde + serde_json
- **Icons**: egui-phosphor 0.10
- **LLM Provider**: OpenRouter API (Claude Sonnet 4 default)

## Development Guidelines
- Use kuzu-memory enhance for all AI interactions
- Store important decisions with kuzu-memory learn
- Query context with kuzu-memory recall when needed
- Keep memories project-specific and relevant
- Follow semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-BUILD format
- Update version files when releasing: `src/version.rs`, `Cargo.toml`, `VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md`
- Use Phosphor icons instead of emojis for UI consistency
- Maintain light theme color scheme for professional appearance

## Session Progress Tracking

**IMPORTANT**: At the end of each work session, create a progress log file in `docs/progress/` to track what was accomplished.

### Session Log Format
- **Filename**: `YYYY-MM-DD-session.md` (e.g., `2025-11-12-session.md`)
- **Location**: `docs/progress/`

### Required Sections in Each Session Log:
1. **Session Overview**: Brief summary of session goals
2. **Features Implemented**: Detailed list of new features/changes
3. **Files Modified**: List of all changed files with brief descriptions
4. **Technical Details**: Data structures, algorithms, key implementation details
5. **Git Commits**: List of commit messages and hashes
6. **Testing**: What was tested and results
7. **Next Steps**: Potential future enhancements or TODOs

### When to Create Session Logs:
- At the end of each development session
- After completing a major feature or milestone
- Before version bumps or releases
- When context is about to be reset/continued

### Example Session Log Entry:
See `docs/progress/2025-11-12-session.md` for a complete example.

This ensures continuity between sessions and allows any Claude instance (Code, Desktop, Mobile) to quickly understand project history and current state.

## Memory Guidelines

- Store project decisions and conventions
- Record technical specifications and API details
- Capture user preferences and patterns
- Document error solutions and workarounds
- Maintain session progress logs for long-term context
